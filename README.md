# EEG-ERP
MATLAB code

These are the MATLAB codes from the preprocessing to statistical analysis for EEG/ERP data using [EEG LAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php) and [ERP LAB](https://erpinfo.org/erplab). </br> It also includes the code for bootstrapping the correlation coefficients of psycholinguistic stimuli and EEG signal and calculate the significance against the chance level (thanks to [HyunChul](https://github.com/Hyun-chul).
